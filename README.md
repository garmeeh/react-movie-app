# Movie App

An app built leveraging the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). The main
purpose of the app was to give me a playground for the latest React goodness.
Built using React, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/),
[Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and trying out styled components for
styling.

Still very much a work in progress, dipping in when I can.
